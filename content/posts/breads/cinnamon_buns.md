__Makes 12 buns__

*From [Erin

### Ingredients

* 4 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 cup warm water
* 1 cup mylk
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 2/3 cup vegan butter
* 2 tsp salt
* 6 cups flour

##### Filling

* 1/2 vegan butter at room temp
* 1 cup white sugar
* 3 tbsp cinnamon
* 2 tbsp cocoa powder (optional)
* 1 cup toasted, chopped pecans

##### Pan Sauce

* 800 mL mylk (coconut, oatly, other mylk with extra fat)
* 2/3 cup brown sugar
* 2 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp vanilla extract, optional

### How to

1. Mix the yeast, sugar, water together and set aside
2. In a sauce pan, combine the mylk, sugars, butter and salt over medium heat until butter is melted. Set aside to cool
3. Add the yeast to the mylk when cool enough so that it won't kill the yeast
4. In a large bowl, add 3 cups flour and mix in the wet ingredients. Add the remaining 3 cups and mix until mostly incorporated. Then, knead it on a lightly floured surface for 8 minutes until the dough is soft and bouncy
5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a wet tea towel. Place in a warm place and let rise for **90 minutes**. For example, in the oven with the light on or a warm room
6. **For the filling**: when the dough has risen mix the utter, sugar and cinnamon
7. **For the pan sauce**: whisk the mylk, sugar, cinnamon and optionally vanilla together and pour it into two greased pans
8. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough in a rectangle 50x40cm and use your hands to shape it correctly. Spread the filling with a spatula and roll from the short side. Using a sharp knife or floss, cut the log into 12 rolls
9. Place the rolls into the pans with the sauce and cover with cling film. Then either:
	* let rise for **45 minutes** in a warm place, or 
	* **refridgerate** overnight and take them out 30 minutes before baking
10. Heat oven to **175%deg;C** and bake for 25 minutes, or until bubbly and golden
11. When they come out, loosen the sides with a knife and turn them over onto a serving platter so the bottom is facing up

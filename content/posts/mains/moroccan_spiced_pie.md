*From [BBC goodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/moroccan-spiced-pie)*

#### Ingredients:

* 2 tsp each coriander and cumin seeds
* 1 tsp paprika, plus extra for dusting
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 150ml olive oil
* 900g squash, peeled and cut into small chunks (about 2cm)
* 12 shallots, quartered
* 4cm piece ginger, finely chopped
* 140g whole blanched almonds
* 140g shelled pistachios
* 75g pack dried cranberries
* 6 tbsp clear honey
* 225g pack fresh spinach
* 400g can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 3 tbsp lemon juice
* 4 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
* 100g vegan butter
* 8 large sheets of filo pastry
* lemon wedges to serve

Harissa yoghurt:

* 200g vegan greek yoghurt
* 6 tbsp mylk
* 3 large sprigs mint, leaves chopped
* 2-3 tbsp harissa paste

#### How to:

1. Preheat the oven to 180C

2. Dry fry the seeds briefly in a small pan over a medium heat until toasty
(don't let them burn!). Grind coarsely using a pestle and mortar 
(or a bowl and the end of a rolling pin), then mix in the paprika, 
cinnamon, 1⁄2 tsp salt and 4 tbsp oil. Put the squash into a baking 
tray or dish, and pour over the spiced oil and toss. Roast for 20 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp of oil in a frying pan, add the shallots and 
cook, stirring, until they start to brown. Stir in the ginger and 
100g each almonds and pistachios. When brown, toss in the 
cranberries, 2 tbsp honey, and the spinach so it wilts. Take off the 
heat and stir into the squash, when it comes out of the oven. Set aside.

4. In a food processor, mix the chickpeas with the garlic, cumin, 
remaining oil, lemon juice, 2 tbsp water and salt and pepper to make 
houmous. Stir in the coriander.

5. Melt the butter in a small pan. Put a loose-bottomed 28cm quiche tin 
on a baking sheet and brush with some butter. Keeping the filo covered with 
a damp cloth so it doesn’t dry out, lay one sheet over half of the tin 
so that it hangs over the edge by about 10cm. Lay another sheet on the 
other side, so it overlaps the first in the centre and hangs over the 
opposite edge. Brush with butter. Lay two more filo sheets in the 
opposite direction in the same way and brush with more butter.

6. Build up two more layers in this way, so you use a total of eight 
sheets of filo. Pile half the squash mixture in the centre of the 
pastry. Spread over the houmous and then the rest of the squash mixture.
One at a time, bring the edge of each filo sheet up to the centre to 
cover the filling, creating voluptuous folds as you go. Brush carefully with more 
butter. (If making a day ahead, cover now with cling film and chill. To 
reheat, remove the pie from the fridge, heat the oven, then bake for 
35-40 minutes.)

7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until crisp and golden. Just before the pie is 
ready, reheat any remaining butter in the pan, tip in the rest of the 
nuts and fry until golden. Spoon in the 4 remaining tbsps of honey and, 
when it melts, take off the heat and pour over the pie. Serve with 
Harissa yogurt sauce (mix the yogurt and milk together to make a thin 
sauce, stir in the herbs and season, swirl in harissa to taste) and 
lemon wedges.

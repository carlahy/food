#### Ingredients

* circa 20 rice paper sheets
* handleful of dehydrated, sliced black mushrooms (woodear), rehydrated
* 1 onion
* 100 g soy sprouts
* 1 carrot
* 1 serving of vermicelli noodles (optional)
* half pack (smoked) tofu (optional)
* handful fresh coriander
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 cl vegan nuoc mam
* 2 pinches of salt
* 20 g of sugar
* 1 L oil for frying

#### How to

1. Prep all the vegetables and herbs, so they are all finely chopped and can form a paste: chop the soy sprouts 
in half, finely dice the onion and garlic, grate the carrot, thinly slice the rehydrated mushrooms, chop the 
coriander
2. Soak (or cook) the vermicelli noodles, and chop them into 5cm long strips using scissors
3. Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl, adding the nuoc mam, salt and sugar
4. Boil a kettle of water and add it to a bowl with some cold water, so that it is hot but not scorching. Wet 
two clean tea towels and wring them out. Lay them on the counter, this is where you will lay the wet rice paper 
rolls
5. Wet a rice paper roll, lay it on the first towel, add the mixture, and roll it up. Lay the roll on the other 
wet towel, and repeat
6. Heat the oil in a frying pan. When hot (test with a clean piece of rice paper), add the rolls. You can fry 
multiple at a time, as long as they don't touch. Fry until they are golden, then remove and dry on a metal grid 
or sieve. Don't use paper towels, it will stick!

#### Ingredients:

* 2 cans white chana (chickpeas) or 340g dried chickpeas
* cooking oil
* ½ tsp cumin seeds (jeera)
* ½ tsp black mustard seeds (rai)
* 2 large onions, finely chopped
* 3 green chillies, finely chopped (optional)
* 2 tsp tomato purée
* ½ tsp chilli powder
* 1½ tsp tandoori masala
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* ½ tsp garlic powder
* 1½ tsp garam masala
* juice of half a lemon

#### How to:

1. Heat oil in a pan and fry the cumin and black mustard seeds for 2 minutes, until fragrant
2. Add the chopped onions and chillies if using, and fry until golden
3. Add the tomato puree, chilli powder, tandoori masala, turmeric, garlic powder, garam masala and lemon juice
4. Cook for a few minutes, then add the chickpeas and cook for a few minutes
5. Add water to cover the chickpeas, salt and simmer for ~10 minutes. I've also tried this recipe with part chopped tomatoes
6. Optionally take a half cup of chickpeas out and blend them, to make the dhal thicker
7. Serve with basmati rice, fresh tomato slices, coriander

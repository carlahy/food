Makes enough for 8 people

#### Ingredients:

* 1.5 cups vegan ground meat (2 store-bought trays), or 1.5 cups cooked lentils. If you want an extra large portion, you can use both
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 5 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 1-2 grated carrots
* 1-2 celery branch, finely chopped
* 1.5 cups mushrooms, finely chopped
* salt & pepper, preferable use 2 tbsp of vegan gravy powder, dark miso or soy sauce instead of salt (umami!)
* 1 tsp sage, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp thyme
* 3 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 can chopped tomatoes
* 1 tbsp mustard
* 3 squirts of liquid smoke, optional
* 1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans, optional
* If you need to bind mixture: 1-3 tbsp cornflour, or 1-2 tbsp flaxseeds
* 1 puff pastry, or 2 if making a large portion

#### How to:

1. Fry the onion and garlic for a few minutes, then add the carrot, celery and ground meat. Fry until veggies are soft
2. Add mushrooms and cook until most of the moisture has gone
3. Add salt, pepper, herbs, tomatoes, sauces, and simmer for 5-10 minutes
4. If you are using lentils, put them in a bowl and roughly mash half. Add them to the pan and mix to combine
5. Add the walnuts, if using
6. Take the pan off the heat and let the mixture cool
7. If using one puff pastry, roll it out on a floured surface and use a rolling pin to thin it out a little. Cut the pastry in half
8. If using two puff pastries, roll one out on a floured surface and have the other one on hand
9. Put the mixture in a log shape in the middle of the rolled-out pastry, and cover it (if only using one, stretch the sides over the top; if using two, cover the log with the other). Tuck in any edges, score the top in criss-crosses and cut shapes from leftover dough to decorate
10. Brush with soy milk mixed with turmeric to give a golden colour. If possible, keep in freezer (or fridge, or outside if its cold) while oven preheats
11. Bake at 200C for 45 mins

Notes: if you want, be creative with the pastry, there is a lot of inspiration online. 

Other note: add or substitute anything you want. For eg. remove the mushrooms and add more carrot, add dried cranberries, add spices like nutmeg or allspice...

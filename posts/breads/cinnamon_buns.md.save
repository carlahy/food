__Makes 12 buns__

### Ingredients

* 2 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1.5 cups warm water (or 1/2 water, 1/2 mylk)
* 1/3 cup vegan butter
* 1 tsp salt
* 3.5 cups flour

##### Filling

* 3 tbsp vegan butter at room temp
* 1/3 cup white sugar
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* 2 tbsp cinnamon

##### Pan Sauce

* 400 mL mylk (oatly, or any other preferably fatty mylks)
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp vanilla extract, optional

### How to

1. Mix the yeast, sugar, warm water together and set aside
2. In a sauce pan, combine the mylk, sugar, butter and salt over medium heat until butter is melted. Set aside to cool
3. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, yeast and mylk when cool enough to not kill the yeast. Knead for 8 minutes until the dough is soft and bouncy
4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a wet tea towel or cling film. Place in a warm place and let rise for **90 minutes**. For example, in the oven with the light on or a warm room
6. **For the filling**: mix the butter, sugar and cinnamon
7. **For the pan sauce**: whisk the mylk, sugar, cinnamon and optionally vanilla together and pour it into a greased pan
8. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough in a rectangle 45x30cm and use your hands to shape it correctly. Spread the filling with a spatula and roll from the short side. Using a sharp knife or floss, cut the log into 8 rolls
9. Place the rolls into the pans with the sauce and cover with cling film. Then either:
	* let rise for **45 minutes** in a warm place, or 
	* **refridgerate** overnight and take them out 30 minutes before baking
10. Heat oven to **175%deg;C** and bake for 25-35 minutes, or until bubbly and golden
11. When they come out, loosen the sides with a knife and turn them over onto a serving platter so the bottom is facing up

#### Ingredients:

##### Dry

* 2 1/4 cup flour
* 1/3-3/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder 

##### Wet

* 2 overripe bananas, mashed
* 1/2 cup soy milk
* 3/4 cup oil
* 1 butter vanilla essence, or 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp rhum

Topping

* 3/4 cup chopped pecans and/or walnuts
* 1-2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp flour
* 1 tbsp cold vegan butter

#### How to:

1. Mix the wet and dry ingredients together in separate bowls
2. Combine them and fold the batter, and do not overmix so that it doesn't form a glutinous dough. Use a spatula rather than a whisk
3. Mix the topping ingredients together with your hands
4. Pour the batter in a greased mold, and sprinkle the topping
5. Bake at 180C for 40-50 mins, until a knife comes out clean. Don't be like me and not check, do check!!
